ThePyrateBay
============

A python script which will check IMDB for movies in a given time frame and then download the top movies from the piratebay (if possible).

This is definitely still a work in progress, as this was something I whipped up in one night when trying to decide what movies to watch.  It relies on libtorrent and ThePirateBay python module and Beautiful Soup.
